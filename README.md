<h3 align = "center"> Note taking app using Javascript using OOP architecture </h3>

## Motivation
I needed a space to keep all the various important websites I came across, while surfing & learning new tech. Thus I came up with this idea to keep them all in one place inside our browser itself.

## Features
- Keep a persistent list of records of important events.
